Curious about the world, ambitious for innovation, and 
stimulated by creativity, nature, and the digital world, I 
started my journey with a passion for drawing. Today I search to
improve myself in areas related to design, biology, and technology 
such as biodesign, speculative thinking, and human experience to 
transform the world around us and foment reflection about our reality 
with projects that converge human needs to our ecosystem to change 
our future perspective.
